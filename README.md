The jupyter notebook creates convolutional neural network of using architects from simplest only single dense layer to network with 2 convolutional layers alongwith max pooling. This notebook was created to see effects with various layers and architects on the accuracies on train and test set of well-known MNIST dataset.<br> 

It also shows the so-called bottle neck effect when number of filters chosen in the second convolutional layers are less than first layer. The backpropagation shuts off many filters in first layer in this case as the second layer acts as bottle neck. This is also major reason that commonly used architects like VGG, MobileNets have a features that there number of filters increase as move deeper into the network. In this notebook, i try to find a reason for such a choice. Even though in Simonyan et. al. 2014, the authors comment the reason for this is the prevent the loss of information.
